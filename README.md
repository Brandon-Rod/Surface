## Tecnologies Used
- MapKit
- Equatable
- Error Handling

## Struggles
- It was my first time using it and getting it to work right and efficiently with a view model. 
- Creating the app icon. It took me hours to create. I had to learn how to mask objects and create complex shapes. I loved how it turned out in the end.
